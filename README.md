# GAME_BOT_RL

This project was done as a part of Advanced Artificial Intelligence(CSC 720) course at
NCSU university.

This project focuses on developing a Game bot that is capable of running a
gameplay on its own and and also completes the game. The project uses Q-learning
Reinforcement Learning to achieve its goal. The game that was used for
this project is a 1980's atari game which is called [mountain
car](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCarContinuous-v0/). The Bot is
designed such that, after multiple iterations, the car in the game is made to
reach the goal.

Explanation about the project is presented as a [paper
](https://github.com/ragabala/GAME_BOT_RL/blob/master/project_paper.pdf). The
project requires OpenAi's [gym](https://pypi.org/project/gym/0.7.4/) package
along with the ``numpy`` package installed.
